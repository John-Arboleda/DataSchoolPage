# Data School Webpage - HTML/CSS Capstone Project

> This is the Capstone project for the Microverse HTML/CSS module. A webpage inspired on the [Creative Commons Global Summit 2015](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) website was implemented.

The main purpose of this project is to put into practice the concepts of **Layout**, **Flexbox**, **Grid** and **Bootstrap**. Indispensable tools for a Web Developer.
